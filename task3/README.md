# Instructions for Running the Flask Web Application

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have a current version of Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup and Execution

After starting the application, it will display the development server's address in the console (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000`). This address may vary, so please refer to the console output.

## Accessing the Application

After launching the application, access it by navigating to the development server's address shown in your console. This will typically be `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. The application will serve its content from this URL.
